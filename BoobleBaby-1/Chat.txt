If you invest in only one building, you will be short of any resource needed to advance. Once you have everything in order, know that other players can steal from you. You can find the size of your army by checking on the map, and then checking your name. Your army can be upgraded by clicking on the flag-looking icon ("barracks") which costs 10 of each resource. Your army may be hurt overtime from attacks, so the icon to the left of the barracks, the house with the plus, is a hospital! You can heal your soldiers there. Good luck!</td></tr>
